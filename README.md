# ETE Demos

These demos were written in March 2018 for an informal presentation about the [ETE3 Toolkit](http://etetoolkit.org/), a great Python package for phylogenetic tree visualization. They are Jupyter notebooks written for Python 3. They are largely based on the tutorial provided on the [ETE3 web site](http://etetoolkit.org/docs/latest/tutorial/index.html), but updated for Python3 and notebooks and in some places modified for the things that I wanted to focus on.

I suggest starting with the ETE3.demo.ipynb, which covers the basics of trees. The ETE3.drawing.demo.ipynb gets into tree drawing.

It would be great if others want to add to these notebooks. I have found that the documentation for ETE3 can be a bit hard to follow or outdated at times, so any additional comments, notes, demos, etc. would make this great toolkit more readily available to a wider audience.
